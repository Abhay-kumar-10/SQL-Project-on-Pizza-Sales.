# SQL-Project-on-Pizza-Sales.

In this project, I have developed SQL queries to address various aspects of pizza sales business analytics.
The analysis questions tackled in this project include:

1.Retrieve the total number of orders placed.

2.Calculate the total revenue generated from pizza sales.

3.Identify the highest-priced pizza.

4.Identify the most common pizza size ordered.

5.List the top 5 most ordered pizza types along with their quantities.

6.Join relevant tables to find the category-wise distribution of pizzas.

7.Group the orders by date and calculate the average number of pizzas ordered per day.

8.Determine the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue.

Conclusion:

Through this project, comprehensive SQL queries were constructed to extract valuable insights from the pizza sales data. The analysis provided a clear understanding of sales performance, customer preferences, and revenue generation. These insights are instrumental for strategic decision-making, helping to optimize inventory, enhance marketing strategies, and ultimately drive business growth.
