# SQL-Project-on-Pizza-Sales.

In this project, I have developed SQL queries to address various aspects of pizza sales business analytics.
The analysis questions tackled in this project include:

Retrieve the total number of orders placed.

Calculate the total revenue generated from pizza sales.

Identify the highest-priced pizza.

Identify the most common pizza size ordered.

List the top 5 most ordered pizza types along with their quantities.

Join relevant tables to find the category-wise distribution of pizzas.

Group the orders by date and calculate the average number of pizzas ordered per day.

Determine the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue.
